I. Used Tools: 

    - $ npm install --save express

II. Core Concepts: 
    1. What is Express: 
        - Framework: Helper functions, tools & rules 
        that help you build your application

        - Express.js: is a NodeJS framework that helps
        us to simplify basics processes of developing
        NodeJS application, such as: handling requests
        and responses, returning pages, etc... 

        - Alternatives to Express.js: 
            +, Basic NodeJS that we have used in 
            the basic of NodeJS (Vanilla Node.JS)
            +, Adonis.js, Koa, Sails.js, etc...
        => Express is the most popular. 
        Big Pros of Express: Very flexible
    
    2. Middleware: 
        - Middleware means that an incoming request is
        automatically handled through a bunch of function 
        by ExpressJS
        - Using Middleware, you can handle request in 
        different pieces of code and don't have to 
        put all the hanling in same function. 

        => Middleware is the core concept of Express

        - See part 2 in III to understand how
        Middleware works in code
